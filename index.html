                Penguins are such majestic creatures. Although they are unable to fly through the atmosphere as do most birds, they glide beautifully
                under the ocean waters. Penguins perform all basic movements gracefully. From the striking beauty of their waddling to the incredible way
                they feed their young. Penguins are truly the apex species of this planet and we as humans are blessed to be able to exist alongside penguins.
